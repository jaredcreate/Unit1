/***** Session 1******/
**Create Scene**
-Name the Scene "Platform Session One"

**Create Main Camrea**
-(INS)Transform -> Postion 0,0,-10

-(INS)Camera -> Set Projection -> Orthographic //This is looks 2D

-(INS)Camera -> Set Size -> 10

-(INS)Camera -> Set Clear Flags -> Skybox

-(INS)Camera -> Set Color -> Student Choose

-(SCE)Toggle on 2D

-(GAM)Set Aspect Ration 16:10 or 16:9 //Depends on the students screen

**Create Platform**
-(PRO)Create a New Folder under your Scene Folder "Textures"

-(PRO) ASSESTS->Find Assets/BayatGames/Free Platform Game Assets/Tiles/2.5D Tiles/(Student Choose)/png/256x256
	-Pick the Simple Square "Grass" Texture
	-Move the texture to your Texture Folder // This is so you can orginize your Assets 
	-Click and Drag The Texture "Grass" -> the Scene 

-(INS) Add a Component [Box Collider 2D] // This is to make sure that the object can have Physics and interrate with other colliders

**Player Character Part 1**
-(PRO) ASSESTS->Find Assets/BayatGames/Free Platform Game Assets/Character/Character Source/png/4x
	-Pick the "Body" Texture
	-Move the texture to your Texture Folder // This is so you can orginize your Assets
	-Click and Drag The Texture "Body" -> the Scene 

-(INS) Add a Compodent [Box Collider 2D] // This is to make sure that the object can have Physics and interrate with other colliders
	-Adjust the Box Collider Size and Ofset for Game Mencincs
		Offset 0x,-0.25y
		Size 2x,2y
-(INS) Add a Compodent [Rigidbody 2D] // This is So the Character can be Affected by Gravity

**Player Character Part 2** //Code
-(PRO) Create a new Folder and name it "Scripts"

-(PRO) Create a C# Script and name it "PlayerControl" and place it in the "Scripts" Folder

-(SCRIPT) Create two globle Float Varibles for Movement and Jump 
    "float moveSpeed;"
    "float jumpSpeed;"

-(SCRIPT) Creates a Global Rigidbody2D Object to store the connection  
    "Rigidbody2D character2D;"

-(SCRIPT)Makes the Connection to the Rigidbody Component of the Player Character in the [void Start()] function
    "character2D = GetComponent<Rigidbody2D>();"

-(SCRIPT)In the [void Update()] Createa a Varible to Gets -1,0,1 depending on if the Left(-1) or Right(1) key is pressed
	"float h = Input.GetAxisRaw("Horizontal");"

-(SCRIPT)Add velocity (speed) as a vector2(x,y)   
        "character2D.velocity = new Vector2(h * moveSpeed, 0);"

		TEST AND SEE THE PLAYER CHARACTER MOVE LEFT TO RIGHT
		OBSERVE THAT THE CHARACTER DOES NOT ACELERATE WHEN FALLING

-(SCRIPT)Add velocity.y (speed) to the vector2(x,y) instead of setting the y velocity to ZERO
		"character2D.velocity = new Vector2(h * moveSpeed, character2D.velocity.y);
		
		TEST AND SEE THE PLAYER CHARACTER MOVE LEFT TO RIGHT
		OBSERVE THAT THE CHARACTER DOES ACELERATE WHEN FALLING

-(INS) Rigidbody2d-> Change the Gravity so the Player Character will fall and not Float down

-(INS) Rigidbody2d-> Toggle Freeze Z On to prevent Rotation of the Player Character
